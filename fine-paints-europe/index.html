		<p>The Netherlands has led the world's paint industry for more than two centuries. Although Holland is about the size of the state of Rhode Island, it has over 120 paint manufacturers including the world's largest paint company, Akzo Nobel.</p>
		<p>The world's premier teaching facility for paint-making technology is the University of Eindhoven. Directly or indirectly, Dutch manufacturers account for more than 20 percent of the world's production of coatings.</p>
		<p>The paints of holland are the best because they are formulated with expensive resins which are carefully combined with high concentrations of finely ground pigments, inexpensive fillers are never used.</p>
