		<p>C2 Guard is a non-toxic product waterproofer designed for use on unsealed wood and concrete surfaces.  C2 Guard contains a flexible polymer that transforms and stabilizes the cellular structure of the wood to prevent water intrusion and dry rot from within.  This enhanced cellular structure resists water penetration, prevents cracking, splitting, or warping, while at the same time reducing the effects of mold and mildew.</p>
